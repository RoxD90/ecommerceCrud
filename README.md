# ecommerceCrud


I want to create a product, tag, and category database using mysql. I have created code that will be able to show one product or all of the products. I am able to update an existing product in Insomnia. I am also able to delete any of the tags, products, or categories if needed. I am also able to add to a new category to my existing categories list using Insonmia. A walkthrough video was created to show each step and the action of each step. Using GET, PUT, and POST in Insomnia, will allow me to do all the steps needed.
